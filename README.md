# InformationSymmetry
Website for Anti-Rug AI and Token

---

## About
InformationSymmetry is an AI Agent project to attempt to minimize the number of rug pulls on the solana network by forcing token creators to show their revealed preference (this is a rug) instead of their stated preference (this is not a rug).

## Features
**Pump.fun Interaction**: Will set up contract on pump.fun automatically and fairly, so that all interested parties learn of CA at the same time.
**Streamflow Interaction**: The AI Agent will lock tokens for a pre-agreed, established time period, using Steamflow, so that the token creator has his initial coins locked away.
**Twitter Interaction**: Agreed contracts will be posted on twitter by the agent with a countdown so that all interested parties have chance to bid on the block immediately after the origin without fear that the developer will "rug" the project.
