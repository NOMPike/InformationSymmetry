# InformationSymmetry
Website for Anti-Rug AI and Token

---

## About
InformationSymmetry is an AI Agent project to attempt to minimize the number of rug pulls on the solana network by forcing token creators to show their revealed preference (this is a rug) instead of their stated preference (this is not a rug).

## Why?

99.996% of coins launched on pump.fun are rugs, forget going for the mystical 100 bagger to make it fair, you need to be looking for a 2000x bagger if you were investing in every coin. This has to stop, if you want retail to enter, if you want Solana Blockchain to be a (semi-)serious space, we have to clean up the act. If we look at the recent Fridon AI farce, where there are >10 LARP Fridon AI tokens you can see that it has got out of hand.

My solution is simple, create an easy to use product that all legitimate projects can use to launch, fairly, at no risk to their supporters. Where all interested parties get the contract ID at the same time.

## Intended Features
**Pump.fun Interaction**: Will set up contract on pump.fun automatically and fairly, so that all interested parties learn of CA at the same time.

**Streamflow Interaction**: The AI Agent will lock tokens for a pre-agreed, established time period, using Steamflow, so that the token creator has his initial coins locked away.

**Twitter Interaction**: Agreed contracts will be posted on twitter by the agent with a countdown so that all interested parties have chance to bid on the block immediately after the origin without fear that the developer will "rug" the project.
